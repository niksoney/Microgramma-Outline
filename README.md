[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Submitted-green)]()

This repository contains the analysis scripts and resources developed for the integrative study of **leaf form complexity** in the *Scaly* clade of the fern genus *Microgramma* (Polypodiaceae).  
The research combines **morphometric**, **spectroscopic**, and **phylogenetic** data to explore patterns of morphological and evolutionary differentiation within this neotropical lineage.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `/Scripts`: R scripts used for morphometric analysis, spectral processing, and phylogenetic modeling.   
- `/Figures`: Includes only the figures and graphical outputs generated from the analyses described in the manuscript.
- `/Data`: The complete raw and processed datasets will be hosted on OneDrive due to their large file size.

## üìä Data and Figures

The **raw datasets**, **statistical outputs**, and **high-resolution figures** generated in this study are currently under embargo.  
Upon formal publication of the article, **all materials will be made publicly available through a OneDrive link**, which will be provided here once the embargo period ends.

## ‚ú® Analysis Highlights

This study integrates multiple analytical approaches to assess species boundaries and phenotypic complexity in *Microgramma*:

- **Elliptic Fourier Analysis (EFA):** Quantifies leaf outline variation and shape diversity across sterile and fertile fronds.  
- **Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy:** Evaluates biochemical and structural traits through FT-NIR reflectance data.  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality and visualizes interspecific variation in morphometric and spectral datasets.  
- **Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS):** Tests evolutionary signal and trait correlations along the *Scaly* clade phylogeny.  
- **Partial Least Squares (PLS):** Integrates spectral and morphological data for predictive modeling of taxonomic groups.

## üß† Key Findings (Summary)

- Leaf morphology and NIR spectra capture **complementary axes of variation** across *Microgramma* species.  
- The integration of spectral and phylogenetic data enhances **species delimitation** and reveals **cryptic morphological overlap**.  
- The study underscores the relevance of **multi-dimensional approaches** in resolving taxonomic complexity in ferns.
