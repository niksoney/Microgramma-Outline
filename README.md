[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Submitted-green)]()

This repository contains the analysis scripts and resources developed for the integrative study of **leaf form complexity** in the *Scaly* clade of the fern genus *Microgramma* (Polypodiaceae).  
The research combines **morphometric**, **spectroscopic**, and **phylogenetic** data to explore patterns of morphological and evolutionary differentiation within this neotropical lineage.

## ✨ Analysis Highlights

This study integrates multiple analytical approaches to assess species boundaries and phenotypic complexity in *Microgramma*:

- **Elliptic Fourier Analysis (EFA):** Quantifies leaf outline variation and shape diversity across sterile and fertile fronds.  
- **Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy:** Evaluates biochemical and structural traits through FT-NIR reflectance data.  
- **Spectral Pre-processing:** Application of `Standard Normal Variate (SNV)` correction to minimize baseline shifts and scattering effects.  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces dimensionality and visualizes interspecific variation in morphometric and spectral datasets.  
- **Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS):** Tests evolutionary signal and trait correlations along the *Scaly* clade phylogeny.  
- **Partial Least Squares (PLS):** Integrates spectral and morphological data for predictive modeling of taxonomic groups.  
- **Comparative Analysis of Frond Dimorphism:** Evaluates the discriminatory power of sterile vs. fertile fronds in both shape and spectra.

## 🧠 Key Findings (Summary)

- Leaf morphology and NIR spectra capture **complementary axes of variation** across *Microgramma* species.  
- The integration of spectral and phylogenetic data enhances **species delimitation** and reveals **cryptic morphological overlap**.  
- The study underscores the relevance of **multi-dimensional approaches** in resolving taxonomic complexity in ferns.
